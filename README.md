# Code Challenges

This repository serves as a container for individual code challenges. 

Each challenge has three branches:
1. The development branch
1. The challenge branch
1. The solution branch

The challenge and solution branches use the name of the development branch with `_challenge` or `_solution` appended to the end of the name. 


### TODO
- [ ] Generate a bash script, placed in the main directory, that parses the name of current branch, and runs `dscreate` with the updated `edit_branch` and `branches` arguments.
