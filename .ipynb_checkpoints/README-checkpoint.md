# Code Challenges

This repository serves as a container for individual code challenges. 

Each challenge has three branches:
1. The development branch
1. The challenge branch
1. The solution branch

The challenge and solution branches use the name of the development branch with `_challenge` or `_solution` appended to the end of the name. 

### Development
The process for developing new challenges:
1. Checkout the `main` branch
1. Checkout a new branch with a descriptive name for the challenge
1. Create an `index.ipynb` jupyter notebook that uses [dscreate](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dscreate) annotations.
1. run `bash create` from command line.
